                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>Last updated: August 06, 2025</p>
                <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is MyToolsPDF's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website, and other sites we own and operate.</p>
                
                <h2>File Security</h2>
                <p>For tools that work in the browser (e.g., Merge PDF, Split PDF, JPG to PDF), your files are never sent to our servers. All processing is done locally on your computer, ensuring that your files remain completely private.</p>
                <p>For tools that require server-side processing (e.g., Compress PDF, PDF to Word), your files are uploaded to our servers over a secure HTTPS connection. We do not store, view, or share your files. All uploaded files are automatically and permanently deleted from our servers within one hour of processing.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you (for example, if you contact us via the contact form). We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We will always let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.</p>
                <p>We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.</p>

                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.</p>

                <h2>Your Consent</h2>
                <p>By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>

                <p>This policy is effective as of 1 January 2025 and was last updated on 1 January 2025. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>
