                        <h3>🎨 Why TIFF Remains the Gold Standard for Professional Imaging</h3>
                        <p>Picture this: You're a museum curator digitizing historical documents, or a medical professional archiving patient records, or a photographer preserving portfolio pieces. In each scenario, image quality isn't just important – it's absolutely critical. This is where <strong>PDF to TIFF conversion</strong> becomes essential for maintaining the highest possible image fidelity.</p>
                        
                        <p>TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) has earned its reputation as the professional standard because it offers <strong>lossless compression</strong>, <strong>exceptional color depth</strong>, and <strong>archival stability</strong>. When you need images that will look exactly the same decades from now, TIFF is your guarantee of quality preservation.</p>

                        <p><strong>For Print Production:</strong> Choose LZW compression to balance file size with quality for efficient workflow management.</p>
                        <p><strong>For Digital Distribution:</strong> Consider your audience's technical capabilities and storage constraints when selecting compression options.</p>
