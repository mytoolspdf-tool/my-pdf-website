                <h1>About MyToolsPDF</h1>
                <p>Welcome to MyToolsPDF, your all-in-one solution for PDF and image file management. Our mission is to provide simple, powerful, and accessible tools that anyone can use, completely free of charge.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>In a world where digital documents are central to our personal and professional lives, we believe that essential tools should not be locked behind expensive subscriptions. We created this platform to empower students, educators, professionals, and individuals to manage their files without barriers. Whether you need to merge a report, compress a presentation, or convert an image, our tools are designed to be intuitive and efficient.</p>

                <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Completely Free:</strong> All our tools are 100% free to use, with no hidden costs or limitations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Privacy-Focused:</strong> Many of our tools work directly in your browser, meaning your files never leave your computer. For tools that require server processing, we use secure connections and permanently delete your files from our servers within an hour. Your privacy is our top priority.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy to Use:</strong> We've designed our website with a clean, user-friendly interface. You don't need to be a tech expert to get your work done. Just drag, drop, and click.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
                <p>We are constantly working to improve our existing tools and develop new ones based on your feedback. Our goal is to be the most reliable and user-friendly platform for file management on the web.</p>
                <p>Thank you for choosing MyToolsPDF. We hope our tools make your life a little bit easier.</p>
